Antiquity - A graph versioning support.

Antiquity provides history support for graph vertices and edges by extending the standard behavior of persistancy operations such as adding, modifying and removing graph elements.

Antiquity is based on Tinkerpop Blueprints project in order to abstract the graph db negotiation and support verious graph engines.
