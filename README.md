Antiquity - A versioned graph.

Antiquity is a versioned graph with full history support for graph elements.

Antiquity is not tight to any specific graph database, this is achieved by using 
Tinkerpop Blueprints project (http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com) which provides an abstraction layer for graph underlines.
